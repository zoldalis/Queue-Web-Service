                C/C++ has many built-in operator types and they are classified as follows: 
 

Arithmetic Operators: These are the operators used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: (+, -, *, /, %,++,–). Arithmetic operator are of two types: 
Unary Operators: Operators that operates or works with a single operand are unary operators. For example: (++ , –)
Binary Operators: Operators that operates or works with two operands are binary operators. For example: (+ , – , * , /)
Relational Operators: These are used for comparison of the values of two operands. For example, checking if one operand is equal to the other operand or not, an operand is greater than the other operand or not etc. Some of the relational operators are (==, >= , <= ). To learn about each of these operators in details go to this link.
